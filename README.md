# Mitchiri Neko March generator

Original Mitchiri Neko March consists of totally 72 characters.

# Workflow

1. Run `mitchiri_png_generate` to generate `images/` subdirectory and PNG files there.
2. Download `mitchiri.mp4` (video only, single track container) and possibly convert it to 1280x720@30FPS.
3. Run `mitchiri_create` to test if images fit into correct positions.
4. Edit everything in `images/` to your own animation frames (stubs are useful to place sprites correctly).
5. Delete `mitchiri.mp4` and run `mitchiri_create` to compile final file.

# Notice

Everything is WIP. Not sure I ever finish it someday.
